# House_Prediction_Regressor_Model
This project is a linear regression-based solution to predict house prices. As my first data science project, I aimed to learn and implement data preparation, model training, and evaluation processes.

Dataset Overview

The dataset used for training the model is HousePrice_train.csv. This dataset includes features like square footage, number of bedrooms, location, and more, which influence the price of a house.

Key steps I undertook to prepare the dataset:

Handling Missing Data: Identified and filled or removed missing values.

Feature Engineering: Selected relevant features and applied transformations.

Scaling: Normalized data to improve model performance.

Model Training and Evaluation

I implemented the model using Python and the Colab environment. Key steps included:

Linear Regression Implementation: Used the scikit-learn library to train a regression model.

Evaluation: Assessed the model’s performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.

Insights Gained

Through this project, I:

Understood the importance of cleaning and preparing data.

Learned the fundamentals of linear regression and how to evaluate model performance.

Developed skills in using Python and Jupyter Notebooks for data science projects.

Conclusion

This project marks the beginning of my journey in data science. I’m excited to explore more complex datasets and advanced models in future projects. Any feedback or suggestions for improvement are welcome!
