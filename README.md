    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This project is a linear regression-based solution to predict house prices. As my first data science project, I aimed to learn and implement data preparation, model training, and evaluation processes.</p>

    <h2>Dataset Overview</h2>
    <p>The dataset used for training the model is <strong>HousePrice_train.csv</strong>. This dataset includes features like square footage, number of bedrooms, location, and more, which influence the price of a house.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Handling Missing Data</strong>: Identified and filled or removed missing values.</li>
        <li><strong>Feature Engineering</strong>: Selected relevant features and applied transformations.</li>
        <li><strong>Scaling</strong>: Normalized data to improve model performance.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

    <h2>Model Training and Evaluation</h2>
    <p>I implemented the model using Python and the Colab environment. Key steps included:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Linear Regression Implementation</strong>: Used the scikit-learn library to train a regression model.</li>
        <li><strong>Evaluation</strong>: Assessed the model’s performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Insights Gained</h2>
    <p>Through this project, I:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Understood the importance of cleaning and preparing data.</li>
        <li>Learned the fundamentals of linear regression and how to evaluate model performance.</li>
        <li>Developed skills in using Python and Jupyter Notebooks for data science projects.</li>
    </ul>
